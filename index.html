        <h1>Seattle Rent and Zoning</h1>
        <h3>By Logan Selley</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>A set of two webmaps that attempt to illustrate both Seattle rent costs and their relative distribution as well as offer some additional insight into why areas are priced the way they are beyond just simple demand.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>The first map aims to show the distribution of Seattle rent prices for housing sizes ranging from studio to 3 bedrooms as well as the overall average for the recognized neighborhood. The second map depicts Seattle zoning, which has an immense
                effect on not just what kind of housing an area has, but the number of units in an area that may be available.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
            <p>For additional context and to add more potential uses, overlays have been added for both maps that include public transit routes for both King County Metro and the Sound Transit Link Light Rail as well as zones that have been designated for
                Mandatory Housing Affordability where new developments in these upzoned areas must contribute to affordable housing which could offer additional insight.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Goal</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Provide people the tools to understand Seattle housing costs and hopefully emphasize the need for continued upzoning for additional density to accomodate for rising demand and continued increasing prices</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Preliminary Findings</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Drawing any conclusive findings purely from correlation between rent costs and area zoning is impossible for a number of external factors to these visualizations since I am not considering any measure of housing availability and demand or
                land value for these areas. It is also true that on this neighborhood level, there are numerous areas that contain a mix of multiple zonings, which goes past the specicifity of our data to draw conclusions from. That being said however,
                when examining some of this data, pricing averages for single family and multi-family areas is largely similar despite differences in the number of units that these lots can hold, but we do see that areas with mixed-use zoning have some
                level of increase in comparrison to the lower zoned residential areas. It should come as no real surprise that prices decrease the further out from the city center you go with a few notable exceptions such as West Seattle with Alki and
                Seaview. MHA zoning is heavily clustered around downtown, but still spreads well into north and south Seattle, which should allow more affordable options for housing going forward.
            </p>
